### Hi there, I'm Josh! 👋
I'm a full-stack engineer at Superconductive, the team behind Great Expectations, as well as a professional lutenist and guitarist. I recently finished a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a three month self-directed retreat for programmers in New York City. While at Recurse, I studied distributed systems, CQRS, TypeScript, GraphQL, and React, and began work on [the History Atlas](https://github.com/joshua-stauffer/thehistoryatlas).

## 🛠️ Recent Projects

###  🌎   🌍   🌏  The History Atlas 
I'm currently building an [open-source social-media inspired wiki](https://github.com/joshua-stauffer/thehistoryatlas) which creates a new way to explore history. Contributors upload scholarly citations and tag people, places, and times. Users explore the data by selecting a person, place, or time, and then scrolling through an event feed of known citations from that entity. As citations come into focus, the places referenced are drawn onto a map. 

The backend is a series of Python microservices which communicate via RabbitMQ. The services are marshalled into a single endpoint GraphQL API using Apollo Server. Client side app is built in React, with state management through Apollo Client. 

Think this sounds like a cool idea? Contributions are welcome - check out the [open issues](https://github.com/joshua-stauffer/thehistoryatlas/issues), and feel free to be in touch!

## 🎸 Music
These days I mostly play the greatest hits of the 17th century on my theorbo, but I've worked as a classical and jazz guitarist as well. Recent performances include concerts at Lincoln Center (New York), Chamber Music New Zealand (New Zealand), Opera Holland Park (London, England), the Royal Opera House (Versailles, France), and Festival de música de Santa Catarina (Jaraguá do Sul, Brazil).
