### Hi there, I'm Josh! 👋
I'm a guitarist/lutenist turned full-stack web developer. I'm currently finishing a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a three month self-directed retreat for programmers in Brooklyn. While at Recurse, I've been studying distributed systems, CQRS, TypeScript, GraphQL, and React, and have been building [the History Atlas](https://github.com/joshua-stauffer/thehistoryatlas).

## 🛠️ Recent Projects

###  🌎   🌍   🌏  The History Atlas 
I'm currently building an [open-source social-media inspired wiki](https://github.com/joshua-stauffer/thehistoryatlas) which creates a new way to explore history. Contributors upload scholarly citations and tag people, places, and times. Users explore the data by selecting a person, place, or time, and then scrolling through an event feed of known citations from that entity. As citations come into focus, the places referenced are drawn onto a map. 

The backend is a series of Python microservices which communicate via RabbitMQ. The services are marshalled into a single GraphQL API using Apollo Server. Client side app is built in React, with state management through Apollo Client. 

Think this sounds like a cool idea? Contributions are welcome - check out the [open issues](https://github.com/joshua-stauffer/thehistoryatlas/issues), and feel free to be in touch!

###  📝 EventBullet
In my first week at Recurse I built [EventBullet](https://github.com/joshua-stauffer/EventBullet), a command line productivity app built in TypeScript, featuring a synchronous CQRS architecture.

### 🐮 🐷 🐶 KuhHandel
I built an [asynchronous game server](https://github.com/joshua-stauffer/Kuhhandel) for the board game Kuh Handel (animal auction) as a way to learn asynchronous programming. Implemented in Python with asyncio and websockets.

### 🌉 The Bridge Between
I built and deployed [the bridge between](https://www.thebridgebetween.org), a resource for contextual therapists. Features [Flask backend](https://github.com/joshua-stauffer/bridge-flask), [interactive visual thesaurus](https://github.com/joshua-stauffer/visual-thesaurus) of technical terms built in D3.js, and a [content management system](https://github.com/joshua-stauffer/dashboard) in React to allow admins to edit and update content across the website.

##  🎵 🎸 Music
These days I mostly play the greatest hits of the 17th century on my theorbo, but I've worked professionally as a classical and jazz guitarist as well. Recent performances include concerts at Lincoln Center (New York), Chamber Music New Zealand (New Zealand), Opera Holland Park (London, England), and the Royal Opera House (Versailles, France).
